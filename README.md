# 🧠 BLoC State Management – Flutter Learning Project

This project marks my first hands-on experience with **Flutter BLoC** and **state management**. It served as a practical sandbox where I explored concepts such as events, states, and business logic components (BLoC), helping me understand how to architect scalable and maintainable Flutter applications.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Understand the fundamentals of the **BLoC pattern**
- Implement real-world **state management** in Flutter
- Learn to separate UI from business logic
- Use the `flutter_bloc` package for clean and reactive development

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- 💙 **Flutter** – UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications
- 🔁 **flutter_bloc** – BLoC package for reactive state management
- 📦 **Dart** – Language powering Flutter
- 🧱 **Equatable** – Simplifies value equality for state comparison

---

## 🧪 What I Learned

- Creating custom BloCs with events and states
- Using `BlocProvider`, `BlocBuilder`, and `BlocListener`
- Handling asynchronous logic in BLoC
- Improving UI responsiveness with efficient state updates

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed
- Dart SDK
- Any Flutter-compatible IDE (e.g., VS Code or Android Studio)

### Run the App

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bloc-learning-app.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd bloc-learning-app

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run
```
